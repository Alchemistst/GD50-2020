# Assignment 2: Breakout
In this assigment we were told to add some extra features to a copy of an old classic game: Breakout. Here is a list of the features I implemented:
* Add powerups:
  * Growth -> makes the paddle longer.
  * Double ball -> adds an extra ball.
  * Heart -> to recover lifes.
  * Key -> if there are locked bricks on the level, this powerup allows you to open them, getting extra points. You will only get one chance to get this powerup per level with a locked brick, so don't lose it!
* Add the spawn of random locked bricks, only possible to open having a Key powerup.
* Loosing a heart resize the paddle back to normal in case of its size being larger by the effect of a Growth powerup.
