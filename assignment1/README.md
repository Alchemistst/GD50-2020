# Assignment 1: Fifty Bird
In this assigment we were told to add some extra features to the Fifty Bird (Flappy Bird copycat):
* Randomize vertical gap between pipes.
* Randomize horizontal spacing of pipes.
* Set medal awards based on score.
* Implement pause/resume feature.
  
As an extra, I also fixed it so the bird can't go above the visible screen, over the pipes, and cheat the game.
